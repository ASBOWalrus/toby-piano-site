            <p class="col-sm-8">Toby is an aspiring young pianist looking 
              for opportunities to spread his love of music to anyone who 
              shares that love. He has a diverse repertoire from love songs 
              to Disney classics. The music Toby plays is always familiar 
              to the listener. A pianist&#8217s repertoire is always expanding, 
              and Toby is therefore happy to learn any pieces that you require.</p>
            <p class="col-sm-8">As a child Toby was a committed member of the 
              local church choir, and has now played the piano for 14 years. 
              His parents&#8217 emphasis on musicianship means that Toby can not 
              only play the notes on the sheets, he can make music of it. 
              During his teenage years, he was awarded his Grade 8 in Piano. 
              More recently he has accompanied choir rehearsals and performed 
              a classical set for Allegro Appassianato in Louth.</p>
